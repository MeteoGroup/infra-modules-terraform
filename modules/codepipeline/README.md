Terraform module to create AWS [`CodePipeline`](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) with [`CodeBuild`](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) for [`CI/CD`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)

This module supports three use-cases:

1. **GitHub -> S3 (build artifact) -> Elastic Beanstalk (running application stack)**.
The module gets the code from a ``GitHub`` repository (public or private), builds it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` file from the repository, pushes the built artifact to an S3 bucket,
and deploys the artifact to ``Elastic Beanstalk`` running one of the supported stacks (_e.g._ ``Java``, ``Go``, ``Node``, ``IIS``, ``Python``, ``Ruby``, etc.).

    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-nodejs-hw.html
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-go-hw.html


2. **GitHub -> ECR (Docker image) -> Elastic Beanstalk (running Docker stack)**.
The module gets the code from a ``GitHub`` repository, builds a ``Docker`` image from it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` and ``Dockerfile`` files from the repository,
pushes the ``Docker`` image to an ``ECR`` repository, and deploys the ``Docker`` image to ``Elastic Beanstalk`` running ``Docker`` stack.
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-docker.html


3. **GitHub -> ECR (Docker image)**.
The module gets the code from a ``GitHub`` repository, builds a ``Docker`` image from it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` and ``Dockerfile`` files from the repository,
and pushes the ``Docker`` image to an ``ECR`` repository. This is used when we want to build a ``Docker`` image from the code and push it to ``ECR`` without deploying to ``Elastic Beanstalk``.
To activate this mode, don't specify the ``app`` and ``env`` attributes for the module.

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "build" {
    source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cicd.git?ref=master"
    namespace           = "global"
    name                = "app"
    stage               = "staging"

    # Enable the pipeline creation
    enabled             = "true"

    # Elastic Beanstalk
    app                 = "<(Optional) Elastic Beanstalk application name>"
    env                 = "<(Optional) Elastic Beanstalk environment name>"

    # Application repository on GitHub
    github_oauth_token  = "(Optional) <GitHub Oauth Token with permissions to access private repositories>"
    repo_owner          = "<GitHub Organization or Person name>"
    repo_name           = "<GitHub repository name of the application to be built and deployed to Elastic Beanstalk>"
    branch              = "<Branch of the GitHub repository>"

    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref.html
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html
    build_image         = "aws/codebuild/docker:1.12.1"
    build_compute_type  = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"

    # These attributes are optional, used as ENV variables when building Docker images and pushing them to ECR
    # For more info:
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-docker.html
    # https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/codebuild_project.html
    privileged_mode     = "true"
    aws_region          = "us-east-1"
    aws_account_id      = "xxxxxxxxxx"
    image_repo_name     = "ecr-repo-name"
    image_tag           = "latest"
    # Optional extra environment variables
    environment_variables = [{
      name  = "JENKINS_URL"
      value = "https://jenkins.example.com"
    },
    {
      name  = "COMPANY_NAME"
      value = "Amazon"
    },
    {
      name = "TIME_ZONE"
      value = "Pacific/Auckland"
   }]
}
```




## Examples

### Example: GitHub, NodeJS, S3 and EB

This is an example to build a Node app, store the build artifact to an S3 bucket, and then deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk running ``Node`` stack


``buildspec.yml`` file

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Starting installation ...
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Installing NPM dependencies...
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
  files:
    - node_modules/**/*
    - public/**/*
    - routes/**/*
    - views/**/*
    - app.js
```

### Example: GitHub, NodeJS, Docker, ECR and EB

This is an example to build a ``Docker`` image for a Node app, push the ``Docker`` image to an ECR repository, and then deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk running ``Docker`` stack

``buildspec.yml`` file

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
      - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION)
